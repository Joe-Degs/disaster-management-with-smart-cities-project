  note = {This package is opensource, reach out to the original author if you want to be a contributor. It was constructed as an analytics framework for an undergraduate thesis, and therefore is shortsighted in its design and inefficient for large workloads, I will continue to make it better and add more functionalities in my free time. All contributions are welcome},
