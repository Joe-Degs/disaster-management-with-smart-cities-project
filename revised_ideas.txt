> because of covid, disasters(flood) will most probably become increasingly harder to
  recover from. we need to start taking proactive approaches to dealing with
  issues like this rather for anticipating their occurrence and waiting for it
  to happen before taking any action.

> different kinds of floods occur and each with differs in the ways it occurs
  and comes with the challenges of how we can deal with them.

> rapid urbanisation does not seem to be making any easier to cope. it is
  getting rediculously harder to manage floods becuase our cities are overcrowded
  and building regulations and zoning rules are almost not paid attention to.

> climate change is fueling this like the changing rainfall patterns making it
  harder to predict weather. The rising levels of is posing increasing damage to
  people living in the coastal regions.

> can we really and truly build cities that are resilient against all this, if
  we think we can, how can we even begin to do it with so many complicated
  challenges blocking the path to any kind of innovation and implementation. 
  Thats what this study seeks to find out.
