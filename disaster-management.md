### Disaster Management
Disaster occur in various forms endangering the lives of people. Natural disasters
are inevitable but man-made disaster are not. Disasters occur and it is our job
as planners to create systems(cities and plans) that are resilient against such
disasters. We cannot do this without understanding the process one has to go through
to create a resilient system that can tolerate disasters. Instrumenting with smart
technologies or building smart cities from the ground up offers lots of opportunities
to create systems that can stand their ground in the wake of natural disasters.

The following 4 phases are gone through to enable us build resilient cities
- mitigation: preparing for future emergencies and taking steps to minimize effects
- preparedness: take steps to be ready for emergency situations
- response: protect people in the wake of emergency/disaster events
- recovery: rebuilding and bringing things back to normal

__Mitigation/Prevention__

  the mitigation phase is before the disaster strikes. at this phase there is time
  to perform risk analysis, build resilient systems and improve how we maintain already
  running systems to protect us in the wake of emergencies. Working to reduce the
  cities vulnerability to disaster is what planners concentrate on in this phase.
  - rezoning and land-use management techniques are used here to prevent impact of
  disasters.
  - community education about potential hazards and how to address them
  - protection and maintenance of critical infrastructure

__Preparedness__

  this phase is also before disaster's strike. At this phase, planners try to understand
  how disaster might affect infrastructure and processes. systems and plans are stress tested
  to prepare them for emergency situations. In the case of smart technologies simulation tests
  are run to look for undefined behaviour of devices in emergency situations. All this is done
  to ensure fast, reliable and effective response times in the wake of disasters.
  Some other things to do to prepare are;
  - installing warning and prediction systems
  - aggregating data from previous emergency situations and analysing to make better decisions
  - prepare emergency plans that involve emergency shelter, evacuation routes and emergency energy
  - contigency planning - advance decisions, allocating resources and organizing logistics before disaster strikes

__Response__

  this phase is in the wake of disasters and involves what should be done to protect lives and protecties
  in emergency situations. Our main focus at this phase is taking pople out of harms way in the wake of
  disasters. Our response is already planned but it is still approach with an opened mind becuase
  disaster are different in their own ways.

__Recovery__
