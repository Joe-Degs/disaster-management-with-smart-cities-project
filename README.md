# Making Cities In Ghana Resilient Against Disasters Using Smart Technologies
I'm trying to figure out what to do as my final year project for school. I like technology,
I write computer programs and the concept of cities using smart technologies to create 
sustainable and resilient living evironments seems like a fun topic to pursue. I want to
concentrate on a specific problem that smart cities might help with in the country and
disaster management seems like a practical thing to look at.

I am trying to tackle specifically the problem of natural disasters and how the country still
relies on ancient ways of disaster management. The advancement of technology has presented
a perfect opportunity which many in the countries in the west have employed in creating cities that
are more resilient against natural and man-made disasters. The application of smart technologies range from 
early disaster detection systems, autonomous forecasting systems, early response systems and
many others.

I am trying to figure out how Ghana can employ this smart systems and technologies to help deal with
of natural disasters by instrumenting our cities to offer the following services; locate victims,
help make efficient evacuation plans and provide fast and reliable emergency response.
Employing these tools might help mitigate the effects of natural disasters on social and economic life in the
country and provide faster recovery process as these systems come with data that can be analysed to speed
up the decision making process.
The data on how effective this will be I don't think i can provide. Most of this will
be based on anecdotal evidence and it feels like it will work even without all the data supporting
it.

Planning smart cities for disaster management has to take the community based approach. The local community has
to be actively part of the process so the practical applications and products do not feel abstracted
from their social and economic life. Community can be made to feel like they are part of the process
through active education on how smart technologies can help them from the dangers of natural disasters.

The main focus is to create a more disaster resilient settlement and improve the quality of life
of inhabitants. The vision is to create a more sustainable and resilient city in the face of natural
disasters.

#### Questions I keep asking myself
- the process of disaster management and how it is made more resilient by technology
- how is disaster management with smart technologies being done by developed countries
- what research is going on in the smart cities space and which people are involved
- how are smart cities being implemented else where in the world.
- are the systems making any changes or notable impact
- how can we in an undeveloped country leverage technology to help us in disaster management
- what specific technologies and tools can be used to implement such systems
- how to actively involve the community in the whole development process
- how do we make the system itself fault tolerant
- will such a project work in a country like Ghana
- how do you test this complex system of systems before deploying for public use.
- how to aggregate data from the system for further analysis and decision making
- since the city's infrastructure is already in place, what will be the best way to
  instrument the city to become a smart city.
- what stake holders are involved in such projects from the design, building, operations,
  to the maintenance of the projects.

## Smart Cities
Smart Cities in the simplest sense employ ICT to create sustainable and efficient living environments
to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants.
Smart technologies and objects play an important role in the implementation of any type of system that seeks 
to make use of data to make decisions that make settlements more sustainable and safe for the people living in it.
The technologies used in the implementation of smart city projects; IOT devices, sensor networks, actuators
and all other smart objects are created to be resource efficient and gentle on the environment.
They consume little power, do not contribute to global warming and are useful in helping make humans 
more efficient in protecting the environment. They also generate tons of data that can be used to make
more informed decisions about our cities.

Smart Cities are made of other system components that make them more sustainable like smart citizens,
smart infrastructure, smart buildings, smart governance, smart transportation, smart energy and 
a smart economy. At the heart of all this components are the Internet of Things(IOT) devices and
complex networks of smart objects that coordinate the processes of all the components and systems into one massive
network that is employed to solve complex problems in settlements and make them more efficient, resilient and
sustainable in the face of natural disasters.

The world of smart cities also has gotten more attention over the past decade and most of the protocols
and critical applications are being standardized to improve interoperability between the different
components of the systems that power such powerful and resilient cities. This is good news because it
makes the implementation of these systems less problematic in areas where alot of research has already
been done.

However, the problem of securing the system of smart technologies making smart cities possible is still
a huge problem that is been actively researched and a lot break throughs are been made by big names
in the IOT space. One popular security architecture that is making waves in the IOT community is the 
"zero trust" security model. Zero Trust security involves security that removes implicit trust from
applications, users or infrastructure even if that entity is within the enterprise perimeter/zone.
It employs the model "never trust, always validate" to prevent malicious actors from getting access into a
system to cause havoc. In cases where malicious actors already have access to the system, it prevents
lateral movement and access to critical resources of the system.

Our cities are complex systems with history, location and context and different components
interacting to keep it alife. But it can only go so far in protecting itself and the organisms
leaning on it for sustainability. Augmenting our cities with technology makes it more resilient
and increases its abilities to cater for our needs and help keep us safe.
