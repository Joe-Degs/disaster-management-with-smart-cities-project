# Forecasting And Mitigating The Effects of Natural Disasters Using Smart Technologies in Ghana
I'm trying to figure out what to do as my final year project for school. And I like technology,
I code, I love the concept of cities using smart technologies so i wanted to do something related
to the application of smart technologies in the country and this seems like a good one to tackle.

I am trying to tackle specifically the problem of natural disasters and how the country still
relies on ancient ways to deal with issues like this. The advancement of technology has presented
a perfect opportunity which many in the west have employed to deal with disasters - in
early disaster detection systems, autonomous forecasting systems, early response systems and
many others.

I am trying to figure out how we can employ this smart systems and technologies to help in times
of natural disasters to; locate victims, help make efficient evacuation plans and help victims
seek help. Employing these tools might help mitigate the effects of natural disasters drastically
in Ghana. The data on how effective this will be, i don't think i can provide. Most of this will
be based on anecdotal evidence and it feels like it will work even without all the data supporting
it.

Planning smart cities for disaster management has to take the community based approach. The local community has
to be actively part of the process so the practical applications and products do not feel abstracted
from their lifes. Community can be made to feel like they are part of the process through active
education on how smart technologies can help them from the dangers of natural disasters.

The main focus is to create a more disaster resilient settlement and improve the quality of life
of inhabitants. The vsion is to have citizens live their lives confident that should any bad thing
happen their city has systems that will step in to help overcome the dangers.

- what are the most important things to consider
  1. the process of disaster management and how it is made more resilient by technology
  2. how is disaster management with smart technologies being done by developed countries
  3. what research is going on in the space
  4. how are smart cities being implemented else where in the world.
  5. are the systems making any changes or notable impact
  6. how can we in an undeveloped country leverage technology to help us in disaster management
  7. what specific technologies can be used to implement such systems
  8. how to actively involve the community in the whole development process
  10. how do we make the system itself fault tolerant
  11. will such a project work in a country like Ghana
  12. how do you test this complex system of systems before deploying for public use.
  13. how to aggregate data from the system for further analysis and decision making
  14. since the city's infrastructure is already in place, what will be the best way to
      instrument the city to become a smart city.
  15. what stake holders are involved in such projects from the design, building, operations,
      to the maintenance of the projects.

## Smart Cities
Smart Cities in the simplest sense employ ICT to create a sustainable and efficient living environment
to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants.
smart cities are critical to the implementation of any type of system that seeks to use technology
to make settlements more sustainable and safe for the people living in it. The technologies used in
the implementation of smart city projects mostly IOT devices, sensor networks and all other smart
objects are created to be resource efficient and gentle on the environment. They consume little power,
do not contribute to climate decline and are useful in helping make humans more efficient in
protecting the environment.

Smart Cities may contain many more smart components that make them more sustainable like smart citizens,
smart infrastructure, smart buildings, smart governance, smart transportation, smart energy and probably
many more others. At the heart of all this components are the Internet of Things(IOT) devices and
complex networks of smart objects that coordinate the processes of all the components into one massive
network that is employed to solve complex problems in settlements and make them more efficient and
sustainable.

The world of smart cities also has gotten more attention over the past decade and most of the protocols
and critical applications are being standardized to improve interoperability between the different
components of the systems that power such powerful and resilient cities. This is good news because it
makes the implementation of these systems less problematic in areas where alot of research have already
been done. You just need to follow standards to interact with the various systems that have already
been developed and to develop new ones you already know the standards to follow to allow interoperability
between other systems developed by other people.

However, the problem of securing the system of smart technologies making smart cities possible is still
a huge problem that is been actively researched and a lot break throughs are been made by big names
in the IOT space. One popular security mode that is making waves in the IOT community is the 
"zero trust" security model. Zero Trust security involves security that remove implicit trust from
applications, users or infrastructure even if that entity is within the enterprise perimeter. It involves
the model "never trust, always validate" this prevents malicious actors from getting access into the
system to cause havoc. And even if they have access to the system, lateral movement is prevented
because for them to access resouces in the network or system they have to be always re-validated to
access those resources.

Our cities are already complex systems with history, location and context and different components
interacting to keep it alife. But it can only go so far in protecting itself and the organisms
leaning on it for sustainability. Augmenting our cities with technology makes it more resilient
and increases its abilities to cater for our needs and help keep us safe.
