### Disaster Management
Natural disasters are inevitable but not all disaster's are. Scientific research and
advancement in technology has led to humans understanding disasters and how it affects society better.
Artificial intelligence, GIS, automation, robotics and other advancements in information technology
has placed humans at a position of understanding and dealing with disasters easier and improving our ability
to make more accurate decisions in emergency situations.

Planners aim to create systems(cities and plans) that are resilient against such
disasters. Prevention efforts and coordinated responses to disasters save lives and lessen
their impact on our cities. To plan cities that are disaster tolerant, it is important that
we work with researchers, engineers, policy makers, emergency managers, business leaders, educators
and all other stakeholders to understand, share data and experience through close communication,
coordination and collaboration. It is also
important to depend on smart and autonomous technological tools to improve disaster preparedness,
mitigation, response and recovery. These technologies help improve monitoring, observations,
analysis, modeling, testing and forecasting and help deal with disasters - before, during and
after it strikes.

Disaster management helps to make cities and communities safer for its inhabitants. When done
properly in the face of emergency situations helps to bring economic, emotional, social life
back to normal within the shortest possible time. 
Partnership between stakeholders to build resilient societies improve its chances of surviving
emergencies and promotes researh, education, awareness, investment into the processes that make our
socities stronger.

The 4 phases involved in the disaster management process are;
- __mitigation__: preparing for future emergencies and taking steps to minimize effects
- __preparedness__: take steps to be ready for emergency situations
- __response__: protect people in the wake of emergency/disaster events
- __recovery__: rebuilding and bringing things back to normal

__Mitigation/Prevention__

  the mitigation phase is before the disaster strikes. at this phase there is time
  to perform risk analysis, plan and build resilient systems and improve how we maintain already
  running systems to protect us in the wake of emergencies. Working to reduce the
  cities vulnerability to disaster is what planners concentrate on in this phase.
  - rezoning and land-use management techniques are used here to prevent impact of
  disasters.
  - community education about potential hazards and how to address them
  - protection and maintenance of critical infrastructure

__Preparedness__

  this phase is also before disaster's strike. At this phase, planners try to understand
  how disaster might affect infrastructure and processes. systems and plans are stress tested
  to prepare them for emergency situations. In the case of smart technologies, simulation tests may
  be conducted to look for undefined behaviour in devices, systems and processes. All this is done
  to ensure fast, reliable and effective response times in the wake of disasters.
  Some other things to do to prepare are;
  - installing warning and prediction systems
  - aggregating data from previous emergency situations and analysing to make better decisions
  - prepare emergency plans that involve emergency shelter, evacuation routes and emergency energy and water sources
  - contigency planning - advance decisions, allocating resources and organizing logistics before disaster strikes

__Response__

  this phase is in the wake of disasters and involves what should be done to protect lives and properties
  in emergency situations. Fast response and protecting people from harms way are the main focus of proffesionals
  at this phase. Stakeholders and all other actors make coordinated and collaborative efforts to provide
  resources and relief to victims. They move to assess damage, revise disaster response plans triage cleanup
  exercises and resource distribution if necessary. As response period progresses, focus is typically shifted from
  immediate emergency response to reconstruction, rehabilitation and repair of damaged infrastructure, utilities
  and processes.

__Recovery__
